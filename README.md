**PLACEMENT PREDICTION AND SKILL GAP ANALYSIS USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING**
**Abstract:**
The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict student placement and indicate any ability gaps. A historical accumulation of student data, encompassing information on their academic performance, extra-curricular activities, and career prospects, will be utilized for training the algorithm. Once trained, the model may be utilized for predicting where new students will be placed and to indicate the skill gaps that need to be filled to increase their chances of success. The historical dataset will be gathered and prepared which will entail cleaning and preparing the data and extracting essential features. Furthermore, create and train the machine learning model and select the model that performs the best on the training data, that will test various machine learning techniques and hyperparameters. After the model has been trained, it can be evaluated using a held- out test set to check the modelâ€™s performance. This research aims to identify prospective candidates' skills gaps in addition to predict placements of the candidates. The technique can identify areas where candidates require additional development by evaluating their abilities and qualifications with the specific requirements of a specific job. To identify these ability gaps, machine learning techniques like clustering and feature significance analysis will be used. The project has the possibility to be beneficial for both institutions and students. The technique can be utilized by students to figure out their strengths and weaknesses and to create personalized learning strategies.
**Steps to run the project:**
**Project requirements:** NodeJs, XAMPP, VSCode
1 Create a react app for the project in the VSCode and include backend and frontend folders.
2 On the backend folder install the environment to run the project using the command 
>>pip3 -m venv myenv
>>myenv\Scripts
>>.\activate
>>pip install flask
4 Then create a python file to run the flask such as main.py and run the flask backend using the command
>>python main.py
5 On the frontend folder install the node_modules if not installed using the command
>>npm install
5 Then start the react app using the command
>>npm start
